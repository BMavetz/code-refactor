# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Project summary

In this project we worked to help a marketing agency, Horiseon, edit an existing codebase for a webpage so that the code followed accessibility standards.  The site was to be optimized for engines as well. Fixes to the code involved editing the main html file to add accessibility standards including the following: using semantic html elements, esuring that elements follow a logical structure, creating alt attributes for images to improve accessibily, confirm heading tags are placed in sequential order, and creating a concise and descriptive title for the webpage.  The css code in the stylesheet was also cleaned up to consolidate coding sections that relied on the same styling, and remove lines of code.  For the purpose of this project, the original coding in the css file was commented out but left in the code to be visible to anyone who wishes to look back and view the original code.
